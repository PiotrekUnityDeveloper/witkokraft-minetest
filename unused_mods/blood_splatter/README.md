# Blood Splatter

Blood splatter for players and all creatures using CMI directly or indirectly through Mobs API. Automatically gets removed after 5 minutes (configurable) or when mapblocks are unloaded (including exiting the game). Thus safe to uninstall at any time without leaving objects behind. Even works with complex blocks such as stairs, corners and slabs. Based on GGraffiti by grorp

It requires at least Minetest 5.6.0. For animal support make sure to install CMI.
