      screen keyboard - WIN</h1>
    The on screen keyboard's standard width is 20 characters. If a
    monitor width is less than 20 characters a brief keyboard layout is
    used, and is 15 characters wide. If a single width monitor is used
    and its text scale less than 2 the on screen keyboard will not be
    useful.<br>
    <br>
    During input from the on screen keyboard the keyboard window adopts
    the target window, sending key and char events directly to the
    target's onKey and onChar handlers through send_event. Any window
    that inherits from the base window object can gain input by passing
    win.KEYINPUT_LINE or win.KEYINPUT_EDIT to its set_want_key_input
    method. The window's on_touch event handler invokes the keyboard. If
    this handler is overridden the base must be called.<br>
