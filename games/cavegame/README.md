# Cave Game
A recreation of Cave Game, the earliest version of Minecraft.

## Features
- Stone and grass nodes.
- Place & destroy them.
- That's about it.

## Notes

Whilst looking like cobble, stone is infact `minecraft:stone`.

Block's ID are aliased to their "modern" Minecraft name.

Select mapgen `singlenode` for a truly flat world.
Mapgen v6 unsupported.

If you want Cave Game's flipped mouse buttons,
change the following in your `minetest.conf`:
```
keymap_dig = KEY_RBUTTON
keymap_place = KEY_LBUTTON
```
