\begin_layout Part*
Advanced Trains 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This mod aims to provide realistic, good-looking and functional trains by
 introducing a revolutionary rail placement system.
 It features several wagons that can be coupled together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This mod is not finished.
 If you miss features, suggest them, but do not denounce this mod just because
 they are not yet implemented.
 They will be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Placing Rails
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Minetest's in-house rail system features rails that turn at an angle of
 90 degrees â€“ totally impractical for the use with realistic trains.
 So we have our own rails.
 Remember: Carts can't drive on the rails provided by this mod, as do trains
 not drive on minetest's default rails because of their different track
 widths.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, craft some rails.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, place one at any position and another one right next to it: you have
 made your first railway track!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To learn how to make turns have a look at the following examples.
 A rail node has been placed only at the red-marked places.
\end_layout

	width 5cm

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As shown in the illustrations above, the 30-degree angled rails use a knight's
 move (2 ahead, 1 aside) for placement.
 For the rails to look realistic, I encourage you not to build turns that
 are too narrow.
 IMO the angles you can build with this are still way to narrow, but this
 is the best compromise I can find.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Switches
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To create switches we need the trackworker tool.
 ATM it looks like a Doctor Who Sonic Screwdriver.
 Aside from turning rails into switches, it is also capable of rotating
 everything (rails, bumpers, signals) in this mod.
 Due to internal mechanics, nothing can be rotated using the default screwdriver.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename manual_img/Bildschirmfoto_2016-09-17_09-56-34.png
	width 5cm

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Place some rails.
 Then left-click 1-2 times on one of these rails, until you see a switch.
 Use right-click to rotate it how you need it.
 You can change the switch direction by right-clicking the switch or by
 powering it with mesecons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately tracks that are placed next to switches don't always automatically
 connect to them.
 You need to correct manually using the Trackworker.
 One day I will implement proper handling for these.
 When you are finished it could look like this:
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Rail crosses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are no real cross-rail nodes.
 However you can create crossing rails by being creative and using the knight's
 move or by placing opposing 45-degree rails.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Height differences 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To master height differences you can craft slope nodes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename manual_img/Bildschirmfoto_2016-09-17_09-45-38.png
	width 5cm

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To place them, you have to prepare the base, then stand in the right direction
 and point to the slope start point, then place it.
 A slope will be constructed in the direction you are facing (45 degree
 steps) leaned against the next solid node.
 The right number of slopes is subtracted from the item stack if you are
 in survival.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Bumpers, platforms, signals and detector rails
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename manual_img/Bildschirmfoto_2016-09-17_09-48-54.png
	width 5cm

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bumpers are objects that are usually placed at the end of a track to prevent
 trains rolling off it.
 After placed, they can be rotated using the Trackworker.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are a regular analog signal and an electric signal.
 Like everything, you can rotate them using the Trackworker.
 Right-click or power with mesecons to signal trains that they can pass
 or have to stop.
 The signals do not have any effect on trains, they can only signal the
 driver.
 A more advanced signalling system (with distant signals/signal combinations)
 is planned.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are some platform nodes.
 I suggest using the left one, it's only half height and looks better.
 These nodes also have a sandstone variant, craft with sandstone bricks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These detector rails turn adjacent mesecons on when a train is standing/driving
 over them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice: Detector rails and bumpers currently aren't aligned to the regular
 tracks.
 This will be fixed soon.
 Meanwhile, you need to rotate them manually.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Trains
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are some wagons included in this modpack, however community members
 (namely mbb and Andrey) have made some more wagons that can be downloaded
 and enabled separately.
 Visit the forum topic (
\begin_inset Flex URL
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=14726
\end_layout

\end_inset

) to download them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To see what's included, look up in a craft guide or consult the creative
 mode inventory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To place wagons simply craft and click a track.
 To remove a wagon, punch it.
 Only the person who placed the wagon can do this.
 In survival if you destroy trains you get only some of your steel back,
 so you will be asked to confirm if you really want to destroy a wagon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Driving trains
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right-click any wagon to get on.
 This will attach you to the wagon and register you as passenger.
 Depending on how the wagon is set up, you are either in a passenger seat
 or inside a driver stand.
 Right-clicking again will show your possibilities on what you can do in/with
 the wagon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename manual_img/Bildschirmfoto_2017-03-09_11-42-49.png
	width 5cm

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When entering a subway wagon, you are formally inside the passenger area.
 You can see this by the fact that there's no head-up display.
 Right-clicking brings up this form.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first button will make you move to the Driver stand, so you can drive
 the train.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second button should say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Wagon properties
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and appears only for the wagon owner.
 See 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Wagon Properties
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last button tells that the doors are closed, so you can't get off at
 this time.
 If the doors are open or the wagon has no doors, this button says 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Get off
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is always possible to bypass closed doors and get off by holding the
 Sneak key and right-clicking the wagon or by holding Sneak and Use at the
 same time.
 Remember that this may result in your death when the train is travelling
 fast.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Japanese train and the Subway train support automatic getting on by
 just walking into the wagon.
 As soon as you stand on a platform and walk towards a door, you will automatica
lly get on the wagon.
 On these, pressing W or S while inside the Passenger Area will also make
 you get off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Train controls
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are inside a driver stand you are presented with a head-up display:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The upper bar shows your current speed and the lower bar shows what speed
 you ordered the train to hold.
 Assuming you have the default controls (WASD, Shift for sneak, Space for
 jump), the following key bindings apply: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
W - faster
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
S - slower / change direction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A / D â€“ open/close doors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Space: brake (shown by =B=, target speed will be decreased automatically)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Sneak+S: set speed to 0 (train rolls out, brake to stop!)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Sneak+W: Set full speed
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Sneak+A: Set speed to 4 (~40km/h)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Sneak+D: Set speed to 8 (~100km/h)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Sneak+Space: toggle brake (the brake will not release when releasing the
 keys, shown by =^B=)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Coupling wagons
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You just learned how to drive an engine.
 Now place a wagon anywhere and drive your engine slowly towards that wagon.
 As soon as they collided your engine will stop.
 Now get off and right-click the green icon that appeared between the engine
 and the train.
 You have coupled the wagon to the engine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To discouple a wagon, punch the red icon between the wagons you want to
 discouple while the train is standing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Automatic Train Control (ATC)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ATC rails allow you to automate train operation.
 There are two types of ATC rails:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Regular ATC
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ATC rail does not have a crafting recipe.
 When placed, you can set a command and it will be sent to any train driving
 over the controller.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Only the static mode is implemented, changing the mode has no effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a detailed explanation how ATC commands work and their syntax see atc_comman
d.txt
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note: to rotate ATC rails, you need to bypass the formspec that is set for
 the node.
 To do this, hold Sneak when right-clicking the rail with the trackworker
 tool.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
LUA ATC
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LUA ATC suite is part of the mod advtrains_luaautomation.
 The LUA ATC components are quite similar to Mesecons Luacontrollers and
 allow to create all kinds of automation systems.
 This tool is not intended for beginners or regular players, but for server
 admins who wish to create a heavily automated subway system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More information on those can be found inside the mod directory of advtrains_lua
automation.
