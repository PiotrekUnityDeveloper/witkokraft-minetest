## mcl_stonecutter
Adds the stonecutter block. Used to cut stone like materials into stairs, slabs, etc. Also used as the Stone Mason Villager's jobsite.

### Adding recipes
* For a source node to be a valid input to the stonecutter it needs to be in the "stonecuttable" group.
* For a resulting node to have a stonecutter "recipe", add a table names _mcl_stonecutter_recipes to the node definition.
  This table should contain the possible source nodes that can be used as a stonecutter "recipe".
* For a yield other than 1 (e.g. slabs) add a group mapping to the "recipe_yield" table in the stonecutter mod.
