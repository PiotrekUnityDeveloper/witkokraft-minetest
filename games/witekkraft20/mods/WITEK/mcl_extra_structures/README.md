Extra Structures for MineClone2
====================
Adds extra structures to the MineClone2 game. Includes structures based on YouTube videos about what could be in future Minecraft updates. This will hopefully be continuously updated and expanded.

Structure List
--------------
* Oasis
* Birch Forest Temple Ruins
* Brick Pyramid
* Graveyard
* Loggers Camp
* Sandstone Obelisks
* Ice Tower

Disabling Specific Structures
-----------------------------
In the minetest.conf file, create a new line (if it doesn't already exist) called `mcl_disabled_structures` and list the structures you wish to disable with each structure seperated by a comma.
Example: `mcl_disabled_structures = desert_oasis, brick_pyramid`

Contributing
------------
If you wish to contribute a structure, create a schematic of the structure and upload it in an issue. If you are knowledgeable about the mineclone2 structure api, git, and coding, create a pull request with the code and schematics.
