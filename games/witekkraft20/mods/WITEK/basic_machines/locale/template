Mover help=
version @1@nSetup: For interactive setup punch the mover and then punch source1, source2, target node (follow instructions). Put the mover directly next to a battery. For advanced setup right click mover. Positions are defined by (x, y, z) coordinates. Mover itself is at coordinates (0, 0, 0).=
@n@nModes of operation: normal (just teleport block), dig (digs and gives you resulted node - good for harvesting farms); by setting 'filter' only selected node is moved, drop (drops node on ground), object (teleportation of players and objects) - distance between source1/2 defines teleport radius; by setting 'filter' you can specify move time - [0.2, 20] - for non players.@nAfter changing from/to object mode, you need to reconfigure sources position.@nInventory mode can exchange items between node inventories. You need to select inventory name for source/target from the dropdown list on the right.@n@nAdvanced:@nYou can reverse start/end position by setting reverse nonzero. This is useful for placing stuff at many locations-planting. If you put reverse @= 2/3 in transport mode it will disable parallel transport but will still do reverse effect with 3. If you activate mover with OFF signal it will toggle reverse.=
@n@nFuel consumption depends on blocks to be moved, distance and temperature. For example, stone or tree is harder to move than dirt, harvesting wheat is very cheap and and moving lava is very hard. High temperature increases fuel consumption while low temperature reduces it.@n@nUpgrade mover by moving mese blocks in upgrade inventory. Each mese block increases mover range by @1, fuel consumption is divided by number of mese blocks in upgrade. Max @2 blocks are used for upgrade.@n@nActivate mover by keypad/detector signal or mese signal through mesecon adapter (if mesecons mod).=

@n@nSetup: To select a target for activation, click "Set" button then click the target.@nYou can add more targets with "Add" button. To see where the target is click "Show" button next to it.@n4 numbers in each row represent (from left to right): first 3 numbers are target coordinates (x, y, z), last number (Mode) controls how signal is passed to target.@nFor example, to only pass OFF signal use -2, to only pass ON signal use 2, -1 negates the signal, 1 passes original signal, 0 blocks signal.@n"view" button toggles view of target names, in names view there is "scan" button which automatically scans for valid targets in a box defined by first and second target.@n@nAdvanced:@nYou can use the distributor as an event handler - it listens to events like interact attempts and chat around the distributor.@nYou need to place the distributor at a position (x, y, z), with coordinates of the form (20*i, 20*j+1, 20*k) for some integers i, j, k.@nRight click holding a distributor in the hand to show a suitable position.@nThen you need to configure first row of numbers in the distributor:@nBy putting 0 as Mode it will start to listen. First number x @= 0/1 controls if node listens to failed interact attempts around it, second number y @= -1/0/1 controls listening to chat (-1 additionally mutes chat)=

@n@nSetup: Right click or punch (left click) the keypad, then follow instructions.@n@nTo set text on other nodes (text shows when you look at node) just target the node and set nonempty text.

@nWhen target is light, you can change the index value (a multiple of 8) with "i<index>".=
@n@nKeyboard: To use keypad as keyboard for text input write "@@" in "text" field and set any password.

Detector help=
Setup: Right click or punch and follow chat instructions. With a detector you can detect nodes, objects, players, items inside inventories, nodes information and light levels. If detector activates it will trigger machine (on or off) at target position.@n@nThere are 6 modes of operation - node/player/object/inventory/infotext/light detection. Inside detection filter write node/player/object name or infotext/light level. If you detect node/player/object you can specify a range of detection. If you want detector to activate target precisely when its not triggered set output signal to 1.@n@nFor example, to detect empty space write air, to detect tree write default:tree, to detect ripe wheat write farming:wheat_8, for flowing water write default:water_flowing... If mode is inventory it will check for items in specified inventory of source node like a chest.@n@nAdvanced:@nIn inventory (must set a filter)/node detection mode, you can specify a second source and select AND/OR from the right top dropdown list to do logical operations.@nYou can also filter output signal in any modes:@n-2@=only OFF, -1@=NOT, 0/1@=normal, 2@=only ON, 3@=only if changed, 4@=if target is keypad set its text to detected object name.=

This machine can move anything.
