A few extra recipes for creating tools from alternate rock types:
Granite, Andesite, Diorite, and Deepslate. The goal is to make finding
them a bit more exciting, although YMMV depending on which kinds of
pickaxes you like to mine with. The resulting tools are better than base
cobblestone variants, but not as good as iron, and of course, they aren't
more powerful than cobblestone in terms of what they can mine. Relative
to base cobblestone tools, these tools have the following differences:

- Andesite: slightly higher durability; slightly longer reach
- Diorite: slightly higher durability; slightly faster swing
- Granite: somewhat higher durability
- Deepslate: much higher durability; slightly faster swing

- I started this by cloning [the mcl_multitool mod by
  DUCKGO](https://codeberg.org/duckgo/mcl_multitool/src/branch/main).
  I've rewritten the code, but leaned on the original as my example to
  work from.
