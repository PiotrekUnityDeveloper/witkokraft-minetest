# Inventory Icon
Version: 2.0.0

## Description
This simple mod adds an icon to the player's HUD at the bottom right corner.
It shows how many inventory slots are available and how many of them are
occupied.

This mod also supports the Bags and Unified Inventory mods. If one of these
mods are used, icons for each bag are displayed, too.
