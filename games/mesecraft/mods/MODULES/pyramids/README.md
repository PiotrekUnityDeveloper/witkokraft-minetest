# Pyramids (with Treasurer support) [`pyramids`]

* Version: 1.0.0

## Description
This is a mod for Minetest Game which adds randomly spawned pyramids in deserts and
sandstone deserts. The pyramids are very rare and contain chests with stuff.

## Historic notes
This mod is a fork of tsm_pyramids by Wuzzy, which itself was a fork of "pyramids" by Blockmen.

This version has been simplified to use only default nodes in the spawning of pyramids. There are no additional functions remaining besides the pyramid spawning.
