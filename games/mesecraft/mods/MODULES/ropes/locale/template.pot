"After a rope ladder is placed on a vertical wall it will begin extending "
"downward until it reaches its maximum length (@1 meters). If the rope ladder "
"is removed all of the ladder below the point of removal will disappear. A "
"rope ladder can be severed partway down using an axe or similar tool, and "
"the ladder below the point where it is cut will collapse. No rope is "
"actually lost in the process, though, and if the uppermost section of the "
"ladder is removed and replaced the ladder will re-extend to the same maximum "
"length as before."

"Rope boxes have a certain amount of rope contained within them specified in "
"the name of the node, and have a limit to how much rope they can support "
"that depends on the material they're made of. The different lengths can be "
"crafted by combining and splitting up rope boxes in the crafting grid. For "
"example, you can craft a @1m rope box by putting a @2m rope box and a rope "
"segment in the crafting grid, or a @3m rope box and two rope segments in the "
"crafting grid. Two rope segments can be recovered by putting the @1m rope "
"box in the crafting grid by itself."

"Ropes are hung by placing rope boxes, which automatically lower a rope of "
"fixed length below them. They can be climbed and cut."

#: doc.lua:39
msgid ""
"When a rope box is placed the rope will immediately begin lowering from it "
"at one meter per second. The rope will only descend when its end is in the "
"vicinity of an active player, suspending its journey when no players are "
"nearby, so a long descent may require a player to climb down the rope as it "
"goes. If you are near the bottom end of a rope that's extending you'll be "
"automatically carried down with it. The rope will stop when it encounters "
"and obstruction, but will resume lowering if the obstruction is removed."

"A rope can be severed midway using an axe or other similar tool. The section "
"of rope below the cut will collapse and disappear, potentially causing "
"players who were hanging on to it to fall. The remaining rope will not "
"resume descent on its own, but the rope box at the top of the rope "
"\"remembers\" how long the rope was and if it is deconstructed and replaced "
"it will still have the same maximum length of rope as before - no rope is "
"permanently lost when a rope is severed like this."

"that juts out away from the location you're standing on."
