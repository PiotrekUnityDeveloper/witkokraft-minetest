**New:** I have updated this mod to work with the craftguide mod. *(Thanks to feedback from FreeGamers.)*

Shown are all my compass and clock mods.

*Based on my hud_compass mod, which provides both a compass and a 24hr clock that can be optionally enabled and placed in any of the four corners of the player's screen.*
