Minetest mod which adds asteroid layers. 

Each layer contains:

1. Asteroids composed of unique materials.
2. Decoration (or lack of) for the asteroid surfaces, including plants and glowing crystals. 
3. A skybox for the layer.

Default layers are Space and Red Sky, but anyone familiar with editing mods should be able to easily adjust these or create different/ additional layers.
