This mod exists to add a little progression to the game so that steel isn't so easy to come by :)

 - Iron Ingots can be made by smelting Iron Ore in a furnace
 - Charcoal can be made by cooking Tree's in a furnace
 - 1x Iron Ingot and 3x Charcoal create a mix that is smelted into 1x Steel Ingot
 - Iron Ingots can be made into blocks which can be used to make stairs
 - Iron blocks and stairs can rust when near water, cook in furnace to remove rust
 - A bucket of water surrounded by Iron Blocks returns 8x Rusted Iron Blocks
 - Added Iron tools which is better than stone but worse than steel/bronze
 - Switched Bronze and Steel tool strength since steel is stronger in real life

Lucky Blocks: 8
